# Raspirator-Python
Raspirator [Python port]
Hopefully, once it becomes a robot. Platform can be any OS with Python machine and GPIO output controller (recomended Raspberry pi)

I hope it will be something like remote control for dron projects with some logic. It can be run on any platform with Python machine and maybe on Android in future. Today futures list is:

Console. It can send commands from client (Master) to server (Raspirator) and interpreted it in system terminal as system command (tunnel)
Binding on GPIO. Use it for dynamic binding GPIO i/o and commands. Not yet
Streaming. Not yet
